-- prefix-metadb-image-paths.sql
--
-- One-time script to prefix bare MetaDB image paths with "metadb://"
-- so the server can route image resolution to the correct plugin.
--
-- Run after deploying the plugin image resolution feature.
-- Safe to run multiple times (skips already-prefixed paths).
--
-- Usage: psql -d silo -f scripts/prefix-metadb-image-paths.sql
