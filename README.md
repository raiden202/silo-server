# Silo

A self-hosted media streaming server with a React frontend and Go backend. Supports direct play, remuxing, and hardware-accelerated transcoding. Compatible with Jellyfin/Emby clients (VidHub, Findroid) via a built-in compatibility layer.

## Deploy with Docker (recommended)

The easiest way to run Silo is with Docker Compose. The default stack assumes you do not already have PostgreSQL and Redis available, so it bundles PostgreSQL, Redis, FFmpeg, and the application for a one-command start.

1. **Create a `.env` file**

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Set your media path**

   Edit `.env` and set:

   ```dotenv
   MEDIA_ROOT=/path/to/your/media
   ```

   `MEDIA_ROOT` is the one value most users need to change. You can also override `SILO_DATA_ROOT` if you do not want bind mounts under `/opt/silo`, and change ports if the defaults conflict with something else on the host.

3. **Start the default integrated stack**

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This starts PostgreSQL, Redis, and the integrated Silo server. The app is available at `http://localhost:8090` and the Jellyfin-compatible endpoint at `http://localhost:8096`.

   If you already have PostgreSQL and Redis available, omit those bundled service examples from compose and point Silo at your existing `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` instead.

4. **Configure through the admin UI**

   Add libraries, users, metadata providers, and playback settings from the web interface.

### Bind Mount Layout

The deploy-oriented compose files use host folder mappings rather than Docker-managed volumes.

By default, data is stored under `/opt/silo`:

- `/opt/silo/postgres`
- `/opt/silo/redis`
- `/opt/silo/transcode`
- `/opt/silo/catalog-seeds`

Media is mounted into the container at `/mnt/media` from the host path you set in `MEDIA_ROOT`.

### Optional Profiles

The main compose file is integrated-first. These profiles exist for operators testing distributed mode or mirroring a split deployment shape. Most single-host installs should stay on the default integrated service, because it already includes proxying and transcoding.

| Profile | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| default | `docker compose up -d` | Integrated server plus bundled PostgreSQL and Redis |
| `proxy` | `docker compose --profile proxy up -d` | Start a standalone proxy service for distributed-mode testing |
| `transcode` | `docker compose --profile transcode up -d` | Start a standalone transcode service for distributed-mode testing |

You can enable both optional examples together:

```sh
docker compose --profile proxy --profile transcode up -d
```

If you are splitting workers across multiple hosts, use the separate remote worker example instead of trying to stretch the main compose file across machines.

### Advanced Remote Node Example

For a dedicated remote transcode worker, use [docker-compose.remote-transcode.yml](docker-compose.remote-transcode.yml). That file is intended for a separate worker host that connects back to an existing Silo deployment using shared PostgreSQL and Redis.

### Deployment Notes

The default compose stack intentionally bundles PostgreSQL and Redis for ease of setup and assumes a fresh install without those services already available. If you already operate PostgreSQL and Redis, omit those examples from compose and point Silo at your existing infrastructure instead. For serious installs, PostgreSQL is better on a separate VM or a managed service so upgrades, tuning, and backups are isolated from the app host. Redis can stay local for many installs, but externalizing it is also reasonable if you already operate shared infrastructure.

Silo is externally stateful by default rather than fully stateless. Durable application state lives in PostgreSQL. Redis only stores coordination and cache-style data. Silo still writes transient transcode output locally under `/tmp/silo-transcode`. If you switch `userdb.backend=sqlite`, Silo also becomes locally stateful at `/var/lib/silo/userdb`.

Migrating an existing Continuum Docker install should be done with the preflight
helper and cutover guide in [docs/continuum-to-silo-docker-migration.md](docs/continuum-to-silo-docker-migration.md).

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Go** 1.24+
- **Bun** 1.0+
- **PostgreSQL** 18+
- **FFmpeg** (for transcoding support)

### Quick Start

1. **Start PostgreSQL** (skip if you already have one running)

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d postgres redis
   ```

   The main compose file still expects `MEDIA_ROOT` to be set even if you only want the bundled PostgreSQL and Redis services, so set that in `.env` first.

2. **Configure the database connection**

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and set `DATABASE_URL` to point to your PostgreSQL instance.

3. **Build and run**

   ```sh
   make build
   ./silo
   ```

   The server starts at `http://localhost:8080` by default. All other settings are configured through the admin UI.

## Development

Local development remains intentionally separate from the deploy-oriented compose setup. Use [docker-compose.dev.yml](docker-compose.dev.yml) and the existing source-build workflow for local development.

```sh
# Run the frontend dev server (hot reload, proxies API to :8090)
make dev-frontend

# Run the Go backend
make dev-backend
```

If you are developing `Silo` and `silo-plugin-sdk` together, keep using the local [`go.work`](go.work) workspace. That workspace is a developer convenience only. CI and release builds run with `GOWORK=off`, so any new SDK helper used here must be pushed and tagged in `silo-plugin-sdk` before this repo can merge or release the change.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution expectations, merge request guidance, and the policy for AI-assisted submissions.

Plugin authors should start with [docs/architecture/plugin-development.md](docs/architecture/plugin-development.md), which covers the RPC plugin package format, generated proto workflow, SDK import paths, route and asset exposure, and auth or user-config integration points.

## Reporting Issues

If you are reporting a bug, install problem, or performance issue, start with the admin workflow and reproduction steps, not Claude/Codex analysis.

Please include:

- What you were trying to do
- Exact steps you took
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- What exact action is slow or broken (`save`, `scan`, `browse`, `import`, `playback`, etc.)
- Whether it happens every time or only sometimes
- The library, media type, filter, setting, or value involved
- Version, branch, commit, and deployment details if you know them
- Screenshots, recordings, or log snippets if relevant

If you used Claude/Codex for debugging, put that under `Technical notes` at the end. Suspected files, SQL output, stack traces, and root-cause theories can be helpful, but only after the workflow and repro steps are clear.

Use this template:

## Configuration

Silo requires only a `DATABASE_URL` when running from source or against external infrastructure. In the default Docker Compose path, the stack wires the database and Redis URLs for you. All other settings — libraries, metadata providers, transcoding, users — are managed through the admin UI after first launch.

### Server Modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| `integrated` | Full server: API + frontend + scanner + transcode (default) |
| `api` | API server only, no local transcoding |
| `proxy` | Stream proxy node that connects to the shared deployment database and Redis |
| `transcode` | HLS transcode worker node that connects to the shared deployment database and Redis |

## PostgreSQL Performance Tuning

The default PostgreSQL configuration is conservative and not optimized for any particular workload. For better performance, use [PGTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) to generate settings tailored to your hardware.

**Recommended PGTune settings:**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| DB Type | **Web application** |
| Total Memory | Your server's RAM |
| Number of CPUs | Your server's CPU count |
| Number of Connections | 20 (Silo's default pool size) |
| Data Storage | SSD or HDD depending on your setup |

Silo's workload is predominantly read-heavy API queries (browse, search, metadata lookups) with the database small enough to fit in RAM for most libraries. The **Web application** profile optimizes for this: CPU-bound simple queries served from cached pages, high concurrent reads, and low write volume.

If you have a very large library (50,000+ items) or heavy activity logging, consider switching to the **OLTP** profile instead.

### Recommended Defaults for Modern Hardware

Assuming you're using modern hardware with fast NVMe storage this is what I'm currently running.

```ini
# Connections
max_connections = 100

# Memory (tuned to keep PG under ~8GB total)
shared_buffers = 4GB               # holds the entire DB in cache (typical DB is 1-4GB)
effective_cache_size = 6GB         # planner hint only, not an allocation
work_mem = 32MB                    # per-operation sort/hash memory
maintenance_work_mem = 512MB       # VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, catalog imports

# WAL / Write Performance
wal_buffers = 64MB
min_wal_size = 512MB
max_wal_size = 2GB
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9

# Storage (NVMe/Optane)
random_page_cost = 1.1             # default 4.0; NVMe random ≈ sequential
effective_io_concurrency = 200     # NVMe handles many concurrent requests

# Parallelism
max_worker_processes = 8
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4
max_parallel_workers = 8
max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 4

# Huge Pages
huge_pages = try
```

These settings keep PostgreSQL under ~8GB of RAM while still caching the entire database. For HDD storage, change `random_page_cost` to `4.0` and `effective_io_concurrency` to `2`.

### Applying Settings

**Docker (recommended):** Save the settings above to a `postgresql.conf` file and mount it into your container:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
postgres:
  image: pgvector/pgvector:pg18
  volumes:
    - ./postgresql.conf:/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf:ro
  command: postgres -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf
```

Then restart: `docker compose restart postgres`

**Existing PostgreSQL:** You can apply settings without editing config files using `ALTER SYSTEM`, which writes to `postgresql.auto.conf` inside the data directory:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '32MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_cache_size = '6GB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET random_page_cost = 1.1;
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_io_concurrency = 200;
-- Apply without restart:
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

-- These require a full restart:
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '4GB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 100;
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_worker_processes = 8;
ALTER SYSTEM SET huge_pages = 'try';
```

Settings like `shared_buffers`, `max_connections`, `max_worker_processes`, and `huge_pages` require a PostgreSQL restart. Memory/planner settings (`work_mem`, `effective_cache_size`, `random_page_cost`) can be reloaded live.
